# **SQLite3 Database Exploration**


**Project Overview**

This notebook demonstrates how to work with an SQLite3 database in Python, focusing on creating tables, inserting data, and running queries. The goal was to practice essential database operations and integrate SQL-based workflows into Python scripts for small to medium-scale data storage and analysis.

**Methods & Results**

I began by connecting to a local SQLite3 database file and creating a table to store structured records. Using SQL queries executed through Pythonâ€™s sqlite3 module, I inserted sample data and verified the records with SELECT statements. I then explored filtering, ordering, and aggregating results directly from Python, showing how database queries can be integrated into an analysis workflow. The process demonstrated how easy it is to transition between database management and Python-based data analysis.

**Key Outputs**

- Created and connected to a local SQLite3 database file
- Defined a new table structure and inserted records
- Executed SQL queries for selection, filtering, and ordering
- Integrated SQL operations within a Python environment

**Conclusion**

This project shows how SQLite3 can be used as a lightweight, portable database solution for Python projects. The ability to manage and query structured data without needing a dedicated database server makes it an excellent option for small-scale applications, prototyping, or educational purposes.
